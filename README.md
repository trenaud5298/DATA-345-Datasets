## ðŸ“˜ About
These datasets are collected from various public sources (primarily the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)) and are intended for educational use in this course.  
They are used to explore applied linear algebra concepts such as:
- Matrix operations and transformations  
- Least-squares regression  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  
- Dimensionality reduction and data projection
